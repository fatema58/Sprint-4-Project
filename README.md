Exploratory Data Analysis Project
Analysis of Factors affecting Advertisement of Vehicles.

Goal
Prepare a report for the vehicles_us dataset to determine whether age, mileage, condition, transmission type, and color influence the advertisement of a vehicle based on the data collected over the last few years.
Based on common sense, we predict the following tendencies:

Hypothesis
on average, the older a vehicle, the lower the number of ad placed;
on average, the higher the price of a vehicle, the higher the days ad was placed;
there is no corelation  between type o f vehicle and no of days ad was placed
vehicles with lower age has higher values thus they are listed longer

This project's repo includes the following files:
The project's final jupyter notebook (EDA.ipynb);
Input data (vehicles_us.csv)
Project description from PTripleten (project description.pdf)

This project includes the following steps:
Descriptive statistics;
Artifacts removal;
Missing values replacement;
Calculations;
EDA: outliers removal;
Analysis of connections between various features and the target variable.

Based on the analysis we have come to the following conclusions:
Ford, Chevrolet and Toyota is the top 3 brands;
On average, the higher the age, the higher the days vehicles are listed;
On average, a vehicle is listed for 33 days as per the median value with a mean of 39.56
The top 3 types of vehicles for which most of the number ads were posted were SUV, truck and sedan.
There is clear connection between price and age of vehicle. the lower the age, the higher the price
